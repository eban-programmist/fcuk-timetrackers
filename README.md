FcukTimeTrackers is here to help you pretend to work while you're busy doing... literally anything else. This macOS app simulates random mouse and keyboard activity to trick time tracking software into thinking you're hard at work.

## What It Does

- **Fake Work**: Simulates random `Cmd+Tab` events to make it look like you're switching between applications.
- **Phantom Mouse**: Moves the mouse around randomly with smooth movements.
- **Ghost Clicks**: Performs random double clicks to give the impression of activity.
- **Customizable**: Choose how long you want to appear "active".
